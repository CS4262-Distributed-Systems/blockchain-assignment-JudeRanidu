### Channels

It is a private layer of communication for the organizations that have been invited to the channel. A separate blockchain ledger exists for each channel. The peers who belong to the invited organizations are joined to the channel to store the channel ledger and validate any transactions which belong to that channel.

### Smart Contracts

They contain the business logic that governs assets on the blockchain ledger. They are invoked by members of the network to manipulate assets on the ledger. Transactions created using smart contracts are signed by multiple organizations before committed to the channel ledger.
